# BattleshipGame
A single player game, based off of the "Battleship" board game. 
The user plays against the computer generated board of randomly distributed "ships", and attempts to sink all ships before the number of shots runs out.
You will have either 50, 25, or 15 shots to sink all of the ships, depending on your difficulty level.
You will enter in a vertical coordinate, then a horizontal one, between 1 and 10.
The horizontal coordinate is ordered left to right, while the vertical coordinate is ordered top to bottom.
After every turn, a grid showing each enetered coordinate will be shown, indicating whether it was a hit or miss.

The pictures to indicate a hit, miss, sunken ship, or victory are ignored on Git; any appropriate images can be used.
